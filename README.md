# Not--A--TODO--APP
 Okay, fine.. it is a todo app, but i want some form of natural language processing in it. I want to test out some things before i actually commit to learning full stack, and if i can make this with python and streamlit, gonna also play around with some streamlit animations to add some sort of character to the app
